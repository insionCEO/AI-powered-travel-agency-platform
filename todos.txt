- use include_str!() for config.ini file (is it possible to still use as .ini?)


Bugs: 
	- ~change time format to 12 hour time~
	- running should be independent of ini file location 

Features:
	- show fraction of correct bets overall
	- automatically send out weekly results [Prio 2]
	- add more modes 
		- Europe mode?
	- always include certain teams in bets
	- send top highlight from reddit to chat with /highlight
	- let users pick time zone (Prio 1)

Done:
	- stop season (/stop) (PRIO 1) [DONE]
		- can only be done by admin after confirmation -> new State needed
		- send final standings to chat and delete polls, bets, ... and chat  
	- when bot is removed from group chat and tries to send weekly polls it 
	  could crash[FIXED]
	  - send out results for a specific week -> inline keyboard (Prio 1) [DONE]
		- ask user for which week he wants to see results, Number from 1 to max_week_for_chat
		- check user input for validity in SendSpecificWeekState:
			- valid: 
				- if week exists send week results
				- else: send message that week X has not been played yet
			- invalid:
				- send message: "Please send me a valid number from 1 to MAX(WEEK)"
